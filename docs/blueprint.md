# **App Name**: Island Bites

## Core Features:

- Location Selection: Allow users to select their location from a dropdown menu with 'Jamaica' and 'Trinidad' options.
- Default Restaurants and Meals: Define default restaurants and meals for each location (Jamaica & Trinidad) as a local JSON object. This information will be used for random meal selection.
- Shake to Decide: Implement a 'Shake to Decide' feature (or button alternative) that randomly selects a restaurant and meal from the current location's list. Include a rolling animation and sound effect.
- Custom Meals: Users can add custom meals (meal name and optional restaurant). Store custom meal data locally using browser storage (like localStorage) to persist data between sessions.

## Style Guidelines:

- Use vibrant, Caribbean-inspired colors such as turquoise, yellow, and green for the primary color scheme.
- Accent color: Coral (#FF7F50) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Utilize food icons and emojis to represent different meals and restaurants.
- Incorporate smooth animations and bounce effects during the dice roll to make it visually appealing.
- Design a clean and intuitive layout with a clear welcome screen, main screen with location selector and 'Roll the Dice' button, and an account page for custom meal management.
